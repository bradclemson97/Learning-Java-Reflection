# Learning-Java-Reflection
Java's reflection API allows you to write a program that can look at itself and even change itself while its running (meta programming). 

In this example, we demonstrate how to use reflection to 'peak' into the structure of a different class and how it can be used to access fields and force change them, even if they are declared as private final. Similarly We also access and invoke methods.
